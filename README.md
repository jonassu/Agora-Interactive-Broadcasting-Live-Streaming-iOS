# **Agora-Interactive-Broadcasting-Live-Streaming-iOS**

This open source sample project demonstrates how to use the Live Streaming API for transcoding。
The small demo contains following features:

- join/leave calls
- publish/unpublish streams
- add transcoding user and start live streaming


## How to run
Firstly you will need to register an account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). With your account logged in, you will be able to create your own test project at dev portal, there you can get your unique AppID. Take a note with your AppID as it will be used in later steps.

```
fileprivate let liveKit = AgoraLiveKit.sharedLiveKit(withAppId: <#Appid#>)

```


Get an available push address, fill in the push address.
```
func streamURL(for room: String) -> String {
   return <#streamURL#>
}
```
Next, download the **Agora Video SDK** from [Agora.io SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/blog/download/). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy the files in **AgoraPushStreaming** folder

- AgoraRtcEngineKit.framework

to the "AgoraPushStreaming" folder in project.

Finally, open the project with XCode, connect the device, compile and run.

## Notice

If you encounter this error, you need to wait for a while before re-streaming.
